This system allows you to write socket-based applications that rely on your TCP implementation instead of the one included in your operating system. To do this, chiTCP provides an alternate socket library, chisocket, that provides the same functions as the standard socket library (connect, send, recv, etc.). Although the chisocket functions have the same expected behaviour as the standard socket functions, they do not implement the entire functionality provided by standard sockets (e.g., non-blocking sockets are not supported).');

While, at a high level, this just involves receiving IP datagrams and figuring out what interface they should be sent on, this requires building additional functionality before you can actually start routing IP datagrams.');
